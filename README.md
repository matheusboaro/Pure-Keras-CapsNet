# Pure-Keras-CapsNet

This CapsNet implementation is based on the Xifeng Guo. You can access the original in the link below:

https://github.com/XifengGuo/CapsNet-Keras

This implementation don't have the decoder and u can feed the network directly with your dataset, you just only need to put the path inside
the "capsulenet.py" file, and run it.
